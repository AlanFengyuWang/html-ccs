        <h1>Here is a a second headline!</h1>
        <p>Hello, World! This is a paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>The style is edited inside the head section instead o fthe body sectoin, one benefit
        is that if we have changes, we don't need to change all the styles in the each body, we 
        only need to change it in the head, style section.
