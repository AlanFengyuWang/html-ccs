            <input type = "text" placeholder = "Full Name" name = "name">
            <button>Submit!</button>
        </form>
        <p>
            Explanation: type is text, it can be number and other types as well
        </p>
        <p>
            "Full Name" is the words that are displayed before the user type
        </p>
        <p>
            "name" is the name of the input, we will use it later (Potentially usable in the backend)
